# K-means-algorithm-
Given a set of N datapoints x1, x2, . . . , xN ∈ R^d , the goal is to group the data into K ∈ N clusters, each datapoint is assigned to exactly one cluster and the number of clusters K is such that 1 &lt; K &lt; N. We will denote the group of clusters by S1, S2, . . . , SK, each cluster Sj is represented by it’s centroid which is the mean µj ∈ R^d of the cluster’s members.
